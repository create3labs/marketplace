            Welcome to SHOWROOM (“Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”)!
            <br />

            <br />
            Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains
            how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from
            your use of our web pages.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy
            (“Agreements”). You acknowledge that you have read and understood
            Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.

          <H2>2. Assumption of Risk</H2>
          <Paragraph>
            You accept and acknowledge:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
              <li>
                The value of an NFTs is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject
                to volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency
                can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You
                acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and
                volatility and that you may lose money.
              </li>
              <li>
                A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development
                of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the
                development of those ecosystems and related applications, and
                could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of
                NFTs.
              </li>
              <li>
                The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
                non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based
                items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may
                materially adversely affect the development of the Service and
                the utility of NFTs.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes
                apply to your transactions. SHOWROOM is not responsible for
                determining the taxes that apply to your NFTs.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with
                content created by third parties through peer-to-peer
                transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of
                purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are
                vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with
                bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent
                and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making
                any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact
                with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
              </li>
              <li>
                We do not control the public blockchains that you are
                interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts
                and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete
                transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally,
                blockchain transactions are irreversible and SHOWROOM has no
                ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain
                based products, including, but not limited to, the risk
                associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections,
                the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
                third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party
                wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that SHOWROOM will
                not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,
                errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the
                Service or any Blockchain network, however caused.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If
                we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform
                providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing
                of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate
                or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms
                and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses
                market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a
                prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will
                suffer.
              </li>
              <li>
                SHOWROOM reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and
                items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items
                you purchase may become inaccessible on SHOWROOM. Under no
                circumstances shall the inability to view items on SHOWROOM or
                an inability to use the Service in conjunction with the
                purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any
                blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against SHOWROOM.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US
                FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE,
                KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
                SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE
                ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD
                OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE
                CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT

          </Paragraph>
          <H2>15. Termination</H2>
          <Paragraph>
            We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service
            immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole
            discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation,
            including but not limited to a breach of Terms.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue
            using Service.
            <br />
            <br />

            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
            and limitations of liability.
          </Paragraph>
          <H2>16. Governing Law</H2>
          <Paragraph>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with all
            applicable laws, which governing law applies to agreement without
            regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
            Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have
            had between us regarding Service.
          </Paragraph>
          <H2>17. Changes To Service</H2>
          <Paragraph>
            We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any
            service or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion
            without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any
            part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From
            time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or
            the entire Service, to users, including registered users.
          </Paragraph>
          <H2>18. Amendments To Terms</H2>
          <Paragraph>
            We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
            site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised
            Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are
            expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any
            changes, as they are binding on you.
            <br />
            <br />
            By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions
            become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you
            do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use
            Service.
          </Paragraph>
          <H2>19. Waiver And Severability</H2>
          <Paragraph>
            No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms
            shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
            condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
            failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall
            not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            <br />
            <br />
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
            competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
            any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
            minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will
            continue in full force and effect.
          </Paragraph>
